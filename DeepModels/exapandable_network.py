'''
this is an experiment on developing an expandable deep learning model
'''

import tensorflow as tf

# investigate learning rate behaviour when growing network
# specify transitianal layers size

# determine input size
# determine output size

# build input layer
# build output layer
# build transisianal layer
# get weights of privious graph
# build new graph
# initialize layers weights
# build the expansion method
