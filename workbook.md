# AI system specs and to-dos
This workbook emphasis the project aim and objectives that have to be achieved among this project

## Objectives:
The ultimate objective of this project is to develop a platform to benchmark different machine learning technologies and
in an advanced step this platform will englobe benchmarking models and models behaviour.


## Requirement:
Models in this project should be implemented in a separate file very easy and understandble 
Use decorators to intake the results that are awaited


## scattred ideas:
### Breaf descreption of what we would like to see:
preferably our logic on building this platform is to build a default architecture for the training and the model importing 
This means that the training and the model building processes should be the same for all the training steps. what should alter the behaviour of our
system is the decorators used when conceiving the training
